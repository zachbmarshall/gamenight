Standing before the fireplace, the two Scotland Yard detectives wait until they are sufficiently thawed out before they finally speak.<br><br>Addressing Holmes and Watson, Gregson relates the circumstances surrounding the curious incident of the tobacco clerk, Manfred Maloney, who was found stabbed to death in the Tobacconist shop this morning.

Penciled into the calendar block containing today's date are the initials \"D.H.\" and the time \"9:00 a.m.\" <br><br>\"Did you find a weapon?\" Watson asks the Scotland Yard detectives. \"No,\" replies Gregson. \"Do you have any witnesses or suspects?\" asks Watson. <br><br>\"None,\" says Gregson. \"The body was found this morning by carriage driver Daniel Hardy, who stopped in the shop to purchase some pipe tobacco.\" <br><br>\"Indeed,\" remarks Inspector Cooke, \"this is a very complex case. It seems too much to hope that we will ever find the solution.\" <br><br>\"Not so, Inspector,\" offers a confident Holmes. \"Quite often, the more complex a case appears on the surface, the simpler is the actual solution.\" <br><br>Holmes assures them they will be able to discover a) who killed the tobacco clerk, b) the weapon, and c) the motive. <br><br>The game is afoot! <br><br>APOTHECARY 236<br> BANK 221<br> CARRIAGE DEPOT 231<br> DOCK 241<br> HOTEL 246<br> LOCKSMITH 251<br> MUSEUM 256<br> NEWSPAPER SHOP 261<br> PARK 266<br> PAWNBROKER 271<br> PLAYHOUSE 216<br> PUB 211<br> SCOTLAND YARD 226<br> TOBACCONIST 276<br>",
                "Spice trade baron Colonel Winfred Startforth has died in India and has willed his entire fortune to his niece, young Maxine Startforth of London. The late Colonel's lawyer, James Pushkin, has wired Sherlock Holmes and asked him to accompany Miss Startforth to the Dock today to meet Mr. Athelney Barlow, a courier from India, who will deliver the Colonel's valuables to Miss Startforth. <br><br>Upon reaching the Dock, Holmes and Miss Startforth find Inspector Lestrade of Scotland yard already there and the courier bludgeoned to death on the foredeck of the Calcutta Queen, a tramp steamer. <br><br>Matthew Bedford, the steamer's first mate, and Bosun Andrew Jamison state that when they last spotted Barlow, the courier was carrying a large valise and a heavy walking stick. Jamison notes that a monkey wrench is missing from a work site on the foredeck. <br><br>All that is found on the dead man's person is a stamped but unmailed letter addressed to Sherlock Holmes and a pocketful of loose change. <br><br>Holmes opens the letter, which simply reads: \"If you are reading this, Mr. Holmes, foul play has occurred. Do not relinquish your search, for a great fortune is at hand.\" <br><br>Captain of the steamer, Hugh Prescott, agrees to remain in port until the crime is solved. Holmes pockets the letter and returns with Mrs. Startforth to Baker Street to reflect on the circumstances of this curious case. Later, Inspector Lestrade arrives with Bosun Jamison in tow. The Inspector holds up a gold-capped walking stick and announces triumphantly, \"You may relax, Holmes. We have the killer and the weapon. We found the courier's walking stick under the Bosun's bunk.\" <br><br>\"On the contrary,\" replies a grinning Holmes. \"You hold no part of the mystery.\" Holmes tells Lestrade that the Inspector has yet to discover a) who killed the courier, b) the weapon, and c) the hiding place of the fortune. <br><br>The game is afoot! <br><br>APOTHECARY 145<br> BANK 150<br> CARRIAGE DEPOT 155<br> DOCK 160<br> HOTEL 165<br> LOCKSMITH 170<br> MUSEUM 175<br> NEWSPAPER SHOP 180<br> PARK 185<br> PAWNBROKER 200<br> PLAYHOUSE 191<br> PUB 205<br> SCOTLAND YARD 190<br> TOBACCONIST 210<br>",
                "Friendly druggist Eugene R. Kane was found murdered this afternoon in the Apothecary. He had been brutally stabbed three times through the heart. <br><br>Scotland Yard has established through a witness that only three persons entered or left the Apothecary during the time of the murder. <br><br>The witness, Mrs. Wilma Farr, who lives two doors from the Apothecary, stated: \"I was sitting outside on my porch waiting for my mail like I always do, when Mr. Kane came by returning from lunch. He stopped for a moment and we chatted. I remember he said he had eaten lunch at the Pub with Mr. Daniel Kirwin, an official at the Museum. Then he said 'Ta ta,' and he went and reopened the Apothecary for business.\" <br><br>Mrs. Farr states that she then observed only three persons enter or leave the Apothecary. These three were Myra Hyatt, a teller at the Bank; Clara Wexler, a Playhouse actress; and Michael Milligan, the neighborhood bobby on beat. All three of these unlikely suspects admit entering the Apothecary shortly after lunch; but all three claim to have left the druggist in good health. <br><br>Mrs. Farr says that after the postman arrived, she read through her mail and found a letter addressed to Mr. Kane which was left with her by mistake. She decided to take the letter to Mr. Kane; and upon arriving at the Apothecary, she found the dead druggist's body and called the police. Inspector Lestrade, who is investigating the murder, has wandered into 221 B Baker Street to collect Holmes' thoughts on the strange incident. <br><br>After listening to Lestrade's account of the case, Holmes reminds the Inspector of one of the cardinal rules of deduction. \"When you have eliminated the impossible,\" says Holmes, \"whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\" <br><br>Scotland Yard is still looking for a) the killer, b) the weapon, and c) the motive.

                "Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard has come to 221 B Baker Street to discuss the curious case of Mr. Winston Dunphy, who was found burned to death in a tool shed on his property three nights ago.<br><br>Dunphy was married to Miss Leslie Scott Rutherford, a wealthy heiress whose late father founded Rutherford Candlemakers, one of the largest beeswax and candlemaking companies in England. <br><br>Dunphy, ten years younger than Leslie Rutherford, met and married the woman three years ago. Since that time, the couple has lived as the only residents of Miss Rutherford's (now Mrs. Dunphy's) modest country estate in Wessex. <br><br>According to Mrs. Dunphy, she last saw her husband three nights ago when he went outside to check on a noise which seemed to come from the tool shed in the back of their house. Suspecting that there might be a prowler on the grounds, Mr. Dunphy took a lighted candle and went outside to check. <br><br>A few minutes later, the tool shed was aflame; and before help could be summoned, the shed burned to the ground. Mr. Dunphy's remains, burned beyond recognition, were found in the charred rubble of the shed. <br><br>The simple explanation for Dunphy's death is that Dunphy surprised a prowler in the tool shed; the prowler knocked Dunphy unconscious and fled; and the lit candle dropped to the ground and set the shed on fire. But Gregson has a feeling that there's more to the case than that. He says he can't put his finger on it; but, for some reason he feels that Mrs. Dunphy is hiding something. <br><br>Holmes and Watson agree to accompany Gregson to Wessex to view the scene of the crime and talk to Mrs. Dunphy. But first Holmes insists that they stop at the Bank. <br><br>At the Dunphy home, Holmes spots a wheelbarrow standing near a back wall and notices deep wheelbarrow impressions leading from the house to the tool shed. Among the tool shed ashes, Holmes finds a large hunk of green beeswax. <br><br>While talking to Mrs. Dunphy in her study, Holmes holds up the beeswax and asks the woman if it is from the candle her husband carried outside three nights ago. Holmes tosses the wax to Mrs. Dunphy. She clasps her legs together, catching the wax in her lap, and then examines it. \"Yes,\" she says, \"it definitely appears to be from the same candle.\" <br><br>Holmes says, \"I thought as much.\" Then the master detective turns to a surprised Gregson and Watson and announces that he has solved the case. Holmes offers to reveal a) the killer, b) the weapon, and c) the motive. <br><br>The game is afoot! <br><br>APOTHECARY 142<br>NEWSPAPER SHOP 177<br> BANK 202<br>PARK 182<br> CARRIAGE DEPOT 152<br>PAWNBROKER 197<br> DOCK 157<br> PLAYHOUSE 193<br> HOTEL 162<br> PUB 147<br> LOCKSMITH 167<br> SCOTLAND YARD 187<br> MUSEUM 172<br> TOBACCONIST 207<br>"];
